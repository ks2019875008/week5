vi and Vim Editors Pocket Reference

Introduction

This pocket reference is a companion to Learning the vi and Nim Editors, by Arnold Robbins et al.
It describes the vi com-mand-line options, command-mode commands, ex com-mands and options, regular expressions
and the use of the substitute (s) command, and other perrinent information for using vi.

While retaining coverage of the vi clones, nvi, elvis, and vile, this edition offers expanded coverage of the
Vim editor, which has becom the de facto standard version of vi in the GNU/Linux world.

The Solaris version of vi served as the "reference" version of the original vi for this pocket reference.
